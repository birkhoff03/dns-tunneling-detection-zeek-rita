# dns-tunneling-detection-zeek-rita
ðŸ§  This project focuses on detecting DNS Tunneling â€” a stealthy method used by attackers to exfiltrate data or maintain command and control via DNS protocol. Using Zeek to extract DNS logs and RITA to analyze network behavior, this lab identifies beaconing and suspicious patterns in DNS traffic.
