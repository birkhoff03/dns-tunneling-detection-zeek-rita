# üîç DNS Tunneling Detection using Zeek and RITA

This repository documents a **real-world DNS tunneling attack** captured in the `specula.pcap` file. The attack shows how malware or attackers can use DNS queries to exfiltrate data via suspicious subdomains (e.g., `cisco-update.com`).

## üìÅ Dataset

Due to GitHub file limits, the PCAP is hosted externally:

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Zeek (Bro)** ‚Äì to analyze PCAP and extract DNS logs
- **RITA (Real Intelligence Threat Analytics)** ‚Äì to detect beacons, suspicious domains, and DNS tunneling behavior


## Files

- **specula.pcap**: The PCAP file used in this analysis.
- **zeek_logs/dns.log**: Logs generated by Zeek after analyzing the PCAP file.
- **rita_logs/dns2.log**: Logs generated by RITA after analyzing Zeek logs.

## Steps

### 1. Zeek Analysis
We used Zeek to convert the `specula.pcap` into DNS logs. The logs were analyzed to identify DNS tunneling behavior.

### 2. RITA Analysis
We imported the Zeek logs into RITA to conduct further analysis. RITA helped identify potential tunneling domains and subdomains.

## Analysis Reports

- **rita_analysis.md**: Detailed analysis of the RITA logs.
- **dns_tunneling_results.md**: Summary of the DNS tunneling results and findings.
